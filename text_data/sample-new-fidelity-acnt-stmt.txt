Al

Investments such as direct participation program securities (e.g., partnerships, limited liability
companies, and real estate investment trusts which are not listed on any exchange), commodity
pools, private equity, private debt and hedge funds are generally illiquid investments and their
current values may be different from the purchase price. Unless otherwise indicated, the values
shown in this statement for such investments have been provided by the management, admin-
istrator or sponsor of each program or a third-party vendor without independent verification by
Fidelity Brokerage Services (FBS) and represent their estimate of the value of the investor's
participation in the program, as of a date no greater than 18 months from the date of this state-
ment. Therefore, the estimated values shown herein may not necessarily reflect actual market
values or be realized upon liquidation. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation informa-
tion is not available.

Accrued Interest Presented for domestic fixed income securities and represents interest
accumulated since the last coupon date, but not yet paid by the issuer or received by NFS. Al is
calculated for the following securities: fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). There
is no guarantee that Al will be paid by the issuer. Al for treasury and GNMA securities,
however, is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. Al totals
represent accruals for only those securities with listed Al in the Holdings section of this
statement. Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity. com for additional information.
See Cost Basis Information and Endnotes for important information about the adjusted cost
basis information provided.

Cost basis information (or proceeds from short sales) has been provided by you and has

not been adjusted except as otherwise indicated. When positions are transferred between
accounts, in certain cases, cost basis information may be automatically transferred and deemed
to be customer-provided.

Includes exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and other exchange-
traded vehicles

EAI Estimated Annual Income (EAl) & Estimated Yield (EY) EAI is an estimate of annual income

&
EY

for a specific security position over the next rolling 12 months. EY is calculated by dividing the
current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EY reflects only
the income generated by an investment, it does not reflect changes in its price, which may
fluctuate. For certain types of securities, EAl and EY could include the return of principal or
capital gains which would render them overstated. EAI and EY are estimates provided for
informational purposes only and should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax
decisions. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAl or EY
presented. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher. EAl and EY should not be
confused with a security's 30-day Yield or 7-day Yield, if provided, as such yield quotations
reflect the actual historical performance of a security. For additional information, including
calculation details, refer to the "Additional Information and Endnotes" section at the end
of your statement.

The stated Interest Rate is the interest rate effective for Cash Balances in your FDIC-Insured
Deposit Sweep on the last day of the statement period.

Position held in margin account. All other positions held in cash account.

Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at the Program Bank to determine
the extent of available FDIC insurance. Subject to the terms of the customer agreement, cus-
tomers are reminded that funds are swept to a Program Bank on the business day following
the date that funds are credited to your account and until swept to a Program Bank, funds are
covered by SIPC. For additional information, please see the FDIC-insured Deposit Sweep
Disclosures on Fidelity. com.

The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months.
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These
estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the

security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. [ADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to
be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.

Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.

Bond & CD Income includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).

Bond & CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon.

Additional Information and Endnotes

Because you may own one or more products or account positions in your
Fidelity account that are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage, we want to
remind you about current FDIC coverage limits and why you should monitor
your balances.

Generally, deposits at a bank held in nonretirement and qualified retirement
accounts such as traditional or Roth IRAs are eligible for up to $250,000
coverage per account owner, per depository institution. Certain holdings at
Fidelity are eligible for "passthrough" FDIC insurance coverage subject to
these same limits. Eligible positions include: 1) Certificates of deposit (CDs) -
Brokered CDs that are issued by an FDIC insured institution, 2) Core
balances in the Fidelity(R) Cash Management Account, eligible Fidelity IRAs
or Fidelity Health Savings Accounts(1), and 3) Any 529 Bank Deposit
Portfolio investments.

You are responsible for monitoring your FDIC coverage. Generally, all the
assets you hold at a depository institution are counted toward the FDIC
coverage limit. Therefore, when considering whether your holdings will be
FDIC insured, you must take into consideration both the combined balance of
all bank deposits (including bank CDs) made directly through a particular
institution as well as those deposits coming about indirectly through Fidelity
or another brokerage firm. For more information about FDIC insurance
coverage, please visit the FDIC Web site at www.FDIC.gov.

* Cash Balances in an account with the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep
Program are swept to an FDIC-insured account at a Program Bank. Funds
are swept to the Program Bank on the business day following the date that
funds are credited to your account and, until swept to the Program Bank,
funds are covered by SIPC. Once at the Program Bank, the deposit is not
covered by SIPC; however, the deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance
coverage subject to the applicable coverage limits. All assets of the account
holder at the Program Bank will generally be counted toward the aggregate
limit. For additional information, please see the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep
Program Disclosure document that can be found at
http:personal.fidelity.comaccountspdfRollover_Sep_Supplemental.pdf

Adjusted cost basis reflects any cumulative original issue discount, premium,
or acquisition premium (including any year-to-date amount). It assumes such
amounts were amortized or accrued for tax purposes from the acquisition
date through the disposition date. Premium amortization was calculated using
the yield-to-maturity method. Acquisition premium was calculated using the
ratable accrual method. Any market discount accretion for this position was
calculated using the straight-line method and, if applicable, recognized upon
disposition. Gain/loss displayed for this transaction is calculated using the
cost basis adjustments, as described above. The adjusted cost basis used
here may not reflect all adjustments necessary for tax purposes (such as
wash sale adjustments) and may not apply if you are using an alternative
amortization calculation method. Refer to IRS Publication 550, Investment
Income and Expenses, for additional information.

If total cost basis information is provided for multiple tax lots, that total cost basis
information (and any associated gain/loss displayed) may have been calculated
using a combination of adjusted cost basis information (as described above) and
non-adjusted cost basis information. Total cost basis information (and any
associated gain/loss displayed) is calculated using adjusted cost basis for lots for
which adjusted cost basis is provided and non-adjusted cost basis for lots for
which adjusted cost basis is not provided or not applicable.

About Your MRD Estimate:

Each year your annual MRD estimate is calculated on or after January 1 using
your prior year-end account balance divided by the applicable life expectancy
factor. The life expectancy factor used is based on both your date of birth and the
beneficiary information we have on file as of December 31st of the prior year.
Please contact Fidelity if there is a change in your beneficiary information as this
calculation will not be updated until the calendar year following the year in which
you change your beneficiary designation.

Year-to-Date distributions include any distributions taken after January ‘1st of the
current year through midnight of the statement end date.

It is your responsibility to satisfy IRS minimum distribution requirements.
Learn more about MRD s at www.Fidelity.com/RDC or call a Fidelity
representative at the number listed on the front of your statement. If you
need specific tax advice be sure to consult with your tax adviser.

EAI for fixed rate domestic bonds and CDs is calculated using the coupon rate.
For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD).
The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months
calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. ADs are
sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can be
made as to accuracy. This third party data may not be promptly updated to reflect
various corporate actions (for example, when an issuer has missed a scheduled
dividend payment, announced changes to a payment schedule, or declared a
‘stock split) and, as a result, the EAl and EY may be over or understated. Interest
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by
current and future economic, political and business conditions. Please refer to
the Help/Glossary on Fidelity.com for additional information regarding these
calculations.

EAI and EY are not provided for: preferred stocks, exchange traded products
(ETFs & ETNs), UITs, variable rate bonds, and international stocks & bonds, but
may be included in the future. EAI is not displayed for amounts less than $10.

purposes. Customers should consult their tax advisors for further information.

Mutual Funds and Performance An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the fund
seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by
investing in the fund. Before investing, consider the funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges and
expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully. Performance
data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and
principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current
performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Visit Fidelity.com/performance for most recent
month-end performance.

412b-1 fees described 'in the prospectus as well as program participation and maintenance fees. Additional
information about the source(s) and amount(s) of compensation as well as other remuneration received by FBS
‘or NFS will be furnished to you upon written request. At the time you purchase shares of funds those shares will
be assigned either a load, transaction fee (TF) or no transaction fee (NTF) status. When you subsequently sell
those shares, any fees applicable to your transaction will be assessed based on the status assigned to the
shares at the time of purchase.

Price Information/Total Market Value The Total Market Value has been calculated out to 9 decimal places;
however, the individual unit price is displayed in 5 decimal places. The Total Market Value represents prices
oblained from various sources, may be impacted by the frequency with which such prices are reported and
such prices are not guaranteed. Prices received from pricing vendors are generally based on current market,
quotes, but when such quotes are not available the pricing vendors use a variety of techniques to estimate
value. These estimates, particularly for fixed income securities, may be based on certain minimum principal
amounts (e.g. $1 million) and may not reflect all of the factors that affect the value of the security, including
liquity risk. The prices provided are not firm bids or offers. Certain securities may reflect N/A or unavailable
where the price for such security is generally not available from a pricing source. The Market Value of a
secutity, including those priced at par Value, may differ from its purchase price and may not closely reflect the
value at which the security may be sold or purchased based on various market factors. The sale or redemption
of any fixed income security prior to maturity may result in a loss. Prices for Certificates of Deposits (CDs) on
your statement are generally estimates and are not based on actual market prices. The secondary market for
CDs is generally illiquid. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior fo making a
financial decision or placing an order.
